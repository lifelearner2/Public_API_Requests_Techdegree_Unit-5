# Public API Requests_Techdegree-Unit 5
 This project is displaying a faux employee directory that pulls from a random generator API on the web. I selected 12 random employees and displayed them on the webpage with their information. I created a modal popup window to appear when an employee card is clicked on to view it closer and with more detailed information. I updated the background color from white to tan and I added a button that allows you to close the modal window and return to the main employee directory.  I also added a search bar on the directory as well as a "view next employee" button on the modal but, unfortunately those buttons are not active at this time.
